        <p>Hey there,

            I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for being such a special friend. Over the past few weeks, our conversations have become a highlight of my days, and I truly enjoy hearing your voice. I have a feeling that our friendship is something truly enduring, even if we’re separated by distance.
            
            Talking to you has become a cherished part of my life, and I appreciate your understanding and kindness, especially when you asked about my daily prayers. Our connection feels so genuine and heartfelt, and I hope it only grows stronger.
            
            You’re my first female friend who has touched my heart in such a meaningful way, and I’ll always hold onto that. Though I might be busy chasing my dreams and we might not talk as often, please know that you’re always in my thoughts. Whenever you need help—or even just want to joke about hacking into something (just kidding!)—or even just a laugh, don’t hesitate to reach out.
            
            Thank you for being a part of my life. I value you more than words can express.</p>
